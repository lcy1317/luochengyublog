# Part Four： DeFi in Action

A reading note for 《How to DeFi Beginner》

## 第十六章 DeFi就是未来！！！

DeFi：

- 透明！
- 可接入！
- 高效！
- 便捷！

DeFi目前的痛点：

- **Wallet** - [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/) is creating a radically better user-focused crypto wallet  experience, with state-of-the-art security, native integration with DeFi Dapps  such as Compound and others, as well as not needing seed keys. 
- **Participation of  products** - [Zapper](https://zapper.fi/) abstracts away many of the complexities and steps involved  with DeFi products. It also allows users to access multiple financial products  in one transaction, saving time and effort. 
- **User-friendly development** - [Gelato  Finance]([play.gelato.finance](https://play.gelato.finance/)) recently launched their“If this, then that” for crypto. It allows users  to set actions that will be done once certain conditions are met, such as“Buy  ETH when it is $200” or“Send some money to Alice when it’s her birthday.”  
- **Insurance** - Financial market effectively facilitates the transfer of risk - one  man’s hedge against his position is another man’s profit. Insurance is now  available via DeFi insurers such as [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/). If you are willing to accept a  lower yield on the money you have placed on lending protocols such as Compound  in exchange for peace of mind, it can now be done. 
- **Aggregation of liquidity** -  There are many different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in the market with  varying liquidity. It is a headache for users to choose which one is the best  for their trade. This is slowly becoming a thing of the past with liquidity  aggregators such as [1inch.exchange](https://app.1inch.io/#/), Paraswap, and Matcha helping users to automatically split orders across DEXs to  ensure the best possible execution prices.
- **Yield optimization** - Remember switching around different banks for the best  rates for fixed deposits? You don’t have to do that in DeFi - yield aggregators  such as Yearn.finance, idle.finance, and DeFiSaver automatically allocate your  cryptoassets to places with the best yield opportunities.

# 浅浅小结一下

How to DeFi: Begginer 这本书其实让我认识到了炒币这种事情属于是太low了，DeFi所展望的远远不是简单的炒币，而是真的带来了一种全新的去中心化的金融模式。

完善的借贷、基金、彩票、衍生品等等DeFi合约属于是让人对目前加密货币的发展有了全新的认识。
